# MilesWK

This is the source code for [https://www.mileswk.com/](https://www.mileswk.com/). I used [Locomotive Scroll](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/) and [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) for the animations and scroll behavior. 

Here are some links for you to check out:

# MilesWK Website
## Version *10*

**Key features**
* GSAP Animations
I think this adds a great feel for the website! I hope everyone else does, too!
* Color w/ dark theme
I have had trouble in the past combining the dark theme (black and white) with color. I think this has been achieved near the bottom of the page
* Better scroll animations
I guess this might be part of the "GSAP" animation section, but I like the animations. 
* It's RESPONSIVE! 
This is amazing! I have a website that looks realllly good on phone!
* The Locomotive Scroll (desktop)
I love the smooth scroll. It only works on a computer. 

**What I will do better next time**
I need a loading screen. For like 0.1 seconds when you visit the page, you can see all the elements.

Overall this is probably one of if not THE best website I have created.

**Inspiration for this website**
* I had a ton of inspiration from the [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) website. It has always been one of my favorites!
* Some of the colors came back from my version 8 website
